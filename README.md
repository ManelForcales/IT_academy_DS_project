IT_Academy_DataScience_project **CryptoPunks**

+ Fase 1-ETL (Extract Transform and Load) the Data
  + We will use Webscrapping to extract the data of all 10000 punks from defypunk
  + load data in a structural format
  + Design Relational Database in SQL or MYSQL using Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
  + load data to the ERD


+ Fase 2-EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
+ Fase 3-Predictions & ML algorithms
+ Fase 4- Informe	

***DATA***:
The *CryptoPunks* are 10,000 uniquely generated characters.
No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain.
Originally, they could be claimed for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed.
Now they must be purchased from someone via the marketplace that's also embedded in the blockchain.
Via this market you can buy, bid on, and offer punks for sale.
Data for each punk can be found in the web <a href="url">https://defypunk.com text</a> about the status of each Punk in the market.
Punks with a blue background are not for sale and have no current bids.
Punks with a red background are available for sale by their owner.
Finally, punks with a purple background have an active bid on them. 

***MAIN OBJECTIVE***:
* Validate or reject the Null Hypothesis
 + Ho = There are no differences in punk price and their groups
 + Ha = There is a difference
